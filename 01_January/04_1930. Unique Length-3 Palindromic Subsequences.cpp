/*
 * 1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences
 *
 * Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.
 * Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.
 * A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
 * For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "aabca"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
 * - "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
 * - "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
 * - "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "adc"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "bbcbaba"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
 * - "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
 * - "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
 * - "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
 * - "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 3 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * s consists of only lowercase English letters.

// Approach 1: For each unique character, find its first and last occurrence and count unique characters between them as each will form a palindrome.
// TC: O(n) since k is bounded by 26 (lowercase English letters), making the actual complexity O(26n) â‰ˆ O(n)
// SC: O(1) since we store at most 26 characters in the sets, making the space usage constant

// Approach 2: Store first and last indices of each character in one pass, then for each character count unique characters between its first and last occurrence.
// TC: O(n) where n is string length since we make two passes through string (first for finding ranges, second for counting unique chars).
// SC: O(1) since we use fixed size array for indices and set stores at most 26 characters.
