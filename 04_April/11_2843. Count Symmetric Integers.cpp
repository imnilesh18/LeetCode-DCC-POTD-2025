 * 2843. Count Symmetric Integers
 *
 * Easy
 *
 * You are given two positive integers low and high.
 * An integer x consisting of 2 * n digits is symmetric if the sum of the first n digits of x is equal to the sum of the last n digits of x. Numbers with an odd number of digits are never symmetric.
 * Return the number of symmetric integers in the range [low, high].
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: low = 1, high = 100
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: There are 9 symmetric integers between 1 and 100: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: low = 1200, high = 1230
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: There are 4 symmetric integers between 1200 and 1230: 1203, 1212, 1221, and 1230.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= low <= high <= 10^4

// Approach 1 (Brute Force): Convert each number to a string, then if it has an even number of digits, split it into two halves,
//           sum the digits in each half, and check if these sums are equal. If equal, increment the count of symmetric integers.
// Time Complexity: O(N * L), where N = (high - low + 1) and L is the maximum number of digits (which is constant here, at most 4 for 10^4).
// Space Complexity: O(L) for converting the number to a string, where L is the number of digits.

// Intuition:

/*
 * Constraint:
 * 1 <= low <= high <= 10^4
 *
 * This means the input range can go up to 10,000.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * Even-Digit Constraint:
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * Since the problem requires us to split the number into two equal halves, the integer must have an even number of digits. In our constraint (up to 10^4), the possible lengths for symmetric integers are:
 *  - 2 digits
 *  - 4 digits
 *
 * (Note: 6-digit numbers are not possible under the given constraint.)
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * 2-Digit Symmetric Integers:
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * For 2-digit numbers, the symmetric integers are those where the sum of the first half (the first digit) is equal to the sum of the second half (the second digit).
 *
 * Observation:
 *  - A 2-digit integer is symmetric if the two digits are equal.
 *  - Therefore, symmetric 2-digit numbers are exactly the multiples of 11.
 *
 * The valid 2-digit symmetric integers are:
 *  11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99
 *
 * These numbers cover the range from 10 to 99.
 *
 * - If the number is a 2-digit number (10 <= num <= 99), then the symmetric integers are those that are multiples of 11. In this case:
 *     if (10 <= num && num <= 99 && num % 11 == 0) {
 *         count++;
 *     }
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * 4-Digit Symmetric Integers:
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * For 4-digit numbers, an integer x is symmetric if the sum of the first two digits equals the sum of the last two digits.
 *
 * Example:
 *  Consider the number 1212.
 *
 *  To extract each digit, we can perform the following operations:
 *     - First digit = 1212 / 1000 = 1
 *     - Second digit = (1212 / 100) % 10
 *                    = 12 % 10 = 2  (since 1212/100 gives 12)
 *
 *  Now, the sum of the first half (first and second digits):
 *     1 + 2 = 3
 *
 *     - Third digit = (1212 / 10) % 10
 *                   = 121 % 10 = 1  (since 1212/10 gives 121)
 *     - Fourth digit = (1212 / 1) % 10
 *                    = 1212 % 10 = 2
 *
 *  Sum of the second half (third and fourth digits):
 *     1 + 2 = 3
 *
 * Since both halves sum to 3, the number 1212 is symmetric.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * How We Extract Digits for 4-Digit Numbers:
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * For a 4-digit number 'num', the operations to extract each digit are:
 *  - 1st digit: num / 1000
 *  - 2nd digit: (num / 100) % 10
 *  - 3rd digit: (num / 10) % 10
 *  - 4th digit: num % 10   (or equivalently, (num / 1) % 10)
 *
 * These operations allow us to get each digit in constant time, and then we can check if the sum of the first two equals the sum of the last two.
 * - If the number is a 4-digit number (1000 <= num <= 9999), then:
 *  1. Extract the first digit by: num / 1000.
 *  2. Extract the second digit by: (num / 100) % 10.
 *  3. Calculate the sum of the first half: first digit + second digit.
 *  4. Extract the third digit by: (num / 10) % 10.
 *  5. Extract the fourth digit by: num % 10.
 *  6. Calculate the sum of the second half: third digit + fourth digit.
 *  7. If both sums are equal, the number is symmetric.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * Approach Summary:
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * - If the number is a 2-digit number (10 <= num <= 99), then the symmetric integers are those that are multiples of 11. In this case:
 *     if (10 <= num && num <= 99 && num % 11 == 0) {
 *         count++;
 *     }
 * - If the number is a 4-digit number (1000 <= num <= 9999), then:
 *  1. Extract the first digit by: num / 1000.
 *  2. Extract the second digit by: (num / 100) % 10.
 *  3. Calculate the sum of the first half: first digit + second digit.
 *  4. Extract the third digit by: (num / 10) % 10.
 *  5. Extract the fourth digit by: num % 10.
 *  6. Calculate the sum of the second half: third digit + fourth digit.
 *  7. If both sums are equal, the number is symmetric.
 *
 * By using these steps, we can efficiently determine if a given integer is symmetric.
