### Problem Statement üìù

Given a `wordlist`, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query word into a correct word. For a given `query` word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes:

1.  **Capitalization**: If the query matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.
    * **Example**: `wordlist = ["yellow"]`, `query = "YellOw"`: `correct = "yellow"`
    * **Example**: `wordlist = ["Yellow"]`, `query = "yellow"`: `correct = "Yellow"`
    * **Example**: `wordlist = ["yellow"]`, `query = "yellow"`: `correct = "yellow"`

2.  **Vowel Errors**: If after replacing the vowels (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`) of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.
    * **Example**: `wordlist = ["YellOw"]`, `query = "yollow"`: `correct = "YellOw"`
    * **Example**: `wordlist = ["YellOw"]`, `query = "yeellow"`: `correct = ""` (no match)
    * **Example**: `wordlist = ["YellOw"]`, `query = "yllw"`: `correct = ""` (no match)

In addition, the spell checker operates under the following **precedence rules**:

1.  When the query **exactly** matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), you should return the same word back.
2.  When the query matches a word up to **capitalization**, you should return the **first** such match in the wordlist.
3.  When the query matches a word up to **vowel errors**, you should return the **first** such match in the wordlist.
4.  If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty string.

Given some `queries`, return a list of words `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the correct word for `query = queries[i]`.

---

### Constraints üìè

* `1 <= wordlist.length, queries.length <= 5000`
* `1 <= wordlist[i].length, queries[i].length <= 7`
* `wordlist[i]` and `queries[i]` consist only of English letters.

### Examples üìä

| Input | Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| `wordlist = ["KiTe","kite","hare","Hare"]`<br>`queries = ["kite","Kite","KiTe","Hare","HARE","Hear","hear","keti","keet","keto"]` | `["kite","KiTe","KiTe","Hare","hare","","","KiTe","","KiTe"]` |
| `wordlist = ["yellow"]`<br>`queries = ["YellOw"]` | `["yellow"]` |

<br>

<details>
  <summary><b>Example 1 Walkthrough</b></summary>
  
* `query = "kite"`: Exact match found: `"kite"`. (Rule 1)
* `query = "Kite"`: No exact match. Case-insensitive match found. First in wordlist is `"KiTe"`. (Rule 2)
* `query = "KiTe"`: Exact match found: `"KiTe"`. (Rule 1)
* `query = "Hare"`: Exact match found: `"Hare"`. (Rule 1)
* `query = "HARE"`: No exact match. Case-insensitive match found. First in wordlist is `"hare"`. (Rule 2)
* `query = "Hear"`: No exact match. No case-insensitive match. No vowel-error match (consonant 'H' vs 'h' is fine, but 'r' vs 'r' is also fine, but "Hear" is not in the vowel-masked map). Result: `""`.
* `query = "hear"`: Same as above. Result: `""`.
* `query = "keti"`: No exact/case match. Check vowel error. `k*t*` (from `keti`) matches `k*t*` (from `"KiTe"`). First match is `"KiTe"`. (Rule 3)
* `query = "keet"`: No match. Consonant 't' vs 'e' error. Result: `""`.
* `query = "keto"`: No exact/case match. Check vowel error. `k*t*` (from `keto`) matches `k*t*` (from `"KiTe"`). First match is `"KiTe"`. (Rule 3)

### Approach üí°

The problem requires us to check queries against a wordlist based on three distinct rules with strict precedence. Iterating the entire `wordlist` for every query would be too slow (O(Q \* W) where Q is num queries, W is num words), given the constraints.

The key is to **pre-process** the `wordlist` into data structures (Hash Maps and a Set) that allow for O(1) average-time lookups. We need to store matches for all three rules. Since rules 2 and 3 require returning the *first* match from the original list, our processing logic must honor this.

We will use three data structures:

1.  **`exactWords` (Set)**: An `unordered_set<string>` to store all original words from the `wordlist`. This allows for a perfect O(1) average lookup for Rule 1 (Exact Match).
2.  **`caseMap` (Map)**: An `unordered_map<string, string>` to handle Rule 2 (Capitalization).
    * **Key**: The word converted to *lowercase*.
    * **Value**: The *original word* (with its original casing).
    * When populating this map, we only add a key-value pair if the lowercase key *does not already exist*. This correctly ensures that only the *first* word in the `wordlist` that maps to a given lowercase version is stored.
3.  **`vowelMap` (Map)**: An `unordered_map<string, string>` to handle Rule 3 (Vowel Errors).
    * **Key**: The word converted to lowercase, with all vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) replaced by a placeholder character (like `*`). For example, "yellow" becomes "y\*ll\*w".
    * **Value**: The *original word*.
    * Similar to `caseMap`, we only add this key-value pair if the vowel-masked key *does not already exist*, satisfying the "first match" requirement.

**Querying Process:**
For each query, we check our data structures *in the order of precedence*:

1.  Check if the query exists in `exactWords`. If yes, return it.
2.  If not, convert the query to lowercase. Check if this lowercase version exists as a key in `caseMap`. If yes, return the corresponding value (the original-cased first match).
3.  If not, convert the lowercase query into its vowel-masked version. Check if this masked version exists as a key in `vowelMap`. If yes, return the corresponding value.
4.  If none of these checks pass, return an empty string `""`.

### Solution Code üë®‚Äçüíª

#### üöÄ Optimized Solution (C++)

```cpp
// Intuition:
// We need to check each query against three matching rules in strict order of precedence.
// To do this efficiently without re-scanning the wordlist for every query (which would be O(N*M)),
// we can pre-process the wordlist into data structures (hash maps and a set) that allow for
// O(1) average-case lookups for each rule. We need one data structure for each rule.

// Approach:
// 1. Create three data structures:
//    - `exactWords` (unordered_set): To store all original words for Rule 1 (Exact Match).
//    - `caseMap` (unordered_map): To store mappings from lowercase words to the *first* original word (Rule 2).
//    - `vowelMap` (unordered_map): To store mappings from vowel-masked lowercase words to the *first* original word (Rule 3).
// 2. Iterate through the `wordlist` ONCE to populate these data structures.
// 3. For each `word`:
//    - Add the original `word` to `exactWords`.
//    - Convert the `word` to lowercase (`lowerWord`).
//    - If `lowerWord` is NOT in `caseMap`, add it: `caseMap[lowerWord] = word`. This ensures only the FIRST occurrence is stored.
//    - Create a vowel-masked version of `lowerWord` (`maskedWord`) by replacing all vowels with '*'.
//    - If `maskedWord` is NOT in `vowelMap`, add it: `vowelMap[maskedWord] = word`. This also stores only the FIRST occurrence.
// 4. Create a `result` vector to store answers.
// 5. Iterate through each `query` in the `queries` list.
// 6. For each `query`, call a helper function `checkForMatch` that applies the precedence rules.
// 7. The `checkForMatch` helper function:
//    - (Rule 1): Check if the original `query` is in `exactWords`. If yes, return it.
//    - (Rule 2): Convert the `query` to lowercase (`lowerQuery`). Check if `lowerQuery` is in `caseMap`. If yes, return the mapped value.
//    - (Rule 3): Create a vowel-masked version of `lowerQuery` (`maskedQuery`). Check if `maskedQuery` is in `vowelMap`. If yes, return the mapped value.
//    - (Rule 4): If no match is found after all checks, return an empty string "".
// 8. Add the string returned by the helper to the `result` vector.
// 9. Return the final `result` vector.

// Time Complexity: O(C + Q), where C is the total number of characters in the wordlist and Q is the total number of characters in the queries.
// Pre-processing the wordlist takes O(C) time, as we iterate each word and its characters to lowercase/mask them (word length is small and constant-bounded, <= 7).
// Processing each query takes O(L) time (where L is the query length, also <= 7) to lowercase/mask it and perform O(1) average-case map/set lookups.
// Total time is dominated by iterating all characters once for processing and once for querying.

// Space Complexity: O(C), where C is the total number of characters in the wordlist.
// In the worst case, we store every word (or a transformation of it) in our three data structures.

//Approach - Using map and set (Provided in prompt, enhanced with comments)
//T.C : O(N), N = total length of all the input strings (wordlist + queries). This matches our O(C+Q) analysis.
//S.C : O(N), N = total length of all strings in the wordlist, to store in the maps/set.

    unordered_set<string> exactWords;       // Rule 1: Stores original words for exact match.

            return vowelMap[maskedQuery]; // Return the first matching original word
        }

        // 4. No match found after all checks
        return ""; // Return empty string
    }

        for (string word : wordlist) {
            // Rule 1: Add every original word to the exact set
            exactWords.insert(word); 

            string lowerWord = toLower(word);
            
            // Rule 2: Populate the case-insensitive map
            // Only add if the lowercase version doesn't exist yet, preserving the "first occurrence" rule
            if (caseMap.find(lowerWord) == caseMap.end()) { 
                caseMap[lowerWord] = word;
            }

            string maskedWord = maskVowels(lowerWord);
            
            // Rule 3: Populate the vowel-error map
            // Only add if the masked version doesn't exist yet, preserving the "first occurrence" rule
            if (vowelMap.find(maskedWord) == vowelMap.end()) { 
                vowelMap[maskedWord] = word;
            }
        }

        // --- Querying Step ---
        vector<string> result; // Vector to store final answers
        for (string query : queries) {

### Key Insights üß†

1.  **Precedence is Critical**: The problem explicitly defines a strict order of rules (Exact > Case-Insensitive > Vowel-Error). Your solution *must* check for matches in this specific sequence.
2.  **"First Match" Rule**: Rules 2 and 3 require returning the *first* word from the original `wordlist` that satisfies the condition. This is why, during our map population, we only insert a key (`lowerWord` or `maskedWord`) if it's not already present. This cleverly "locks in" the very first original word we encounter for each transformed key.
3.  **Use the Right Data Structure**:
    * An `unordered_set` is perfect for Rule 1 (Exact Match) due to its O(1) average lookup time.
    * `unordered_map` is the ideal choice for Rules 2 and 3. It provides an O(1) average-time bridge from a *transformed key* (lowercase or vowel-masked) back to the *original value* we need to return.
4.  **Vowel Masking**: The simplest way to handle the vowel error (Rule 3) is to "de-vowel" the words. By converting all vowels to a single placeholder (like `*`) *after* making the string lowercase, we create a common key. For example, `keto`, `kAti`, `kIte`, and `kuti` all become `k*t*`, allowing them to match the same entry in the `vowelMap`.

### Further Exploration üß≠

* What if consonants could also be mistaken, but only for "similar-sounding" ones (e.g., 'f' vs 'ph')? How would you design a map for that?
* This problem uses maps to store the *first* valid match. What if you needed to return *all* valid matches for a query? You would change the map values from `string` to `vector<string>`, but this would significantly change the logic.
