## üìù Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is a digit between `0` and `9` (inclusive).

The **triangular sum** of `nums` is the value of the only element present in `nums` after the following process terminates:

1.  Let `nums` comprise `n` elements. If `n == 1`, **end** the process. Otherwise, **create** a new **0-indexed** integer array `newNums` of length `n - 1`.
2.  For each index `i`, where `0 <= i < n - 1`, **assign** the value of `newNums[i]` as `(nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10`.
3.  **Replace** the array `nums` with `newNums`.
4.  **Repeat** the entire process starting from step 1.

Return the triangular sum of `nums`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 9`

| `nums = [5]`         | `5`    | The array already has only one element, so the process terminates, and the triangular sum is the element itself. |

## üß† Approach

The problem asks us to repeatedly transform an array until only one element remains. This process involves creating a new array where each element is the sum (modulo 10) of two adjacent elements from the previous array. This suggests a simulation-based approach.

We can visualize this as layers of a triangle, where each layer is smaller than the one above it. The most direct method is to simulate this process step-by-step:

1.  Start with the initial array.
2.  As long as the array has more than one element, create a new temporary array.
3.  Populate the temporary array by calculating `(nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10` for each `i`.
4.  Replace the original array with this new, smaller array.
5.  Repeat until the array size becomes 1.

A more space-efficient approach avoids creating a new array in each step. We can perform the updates **in-place**. Since the new value at `nums[i]` depends only on the original `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]`, we can overwrite `nums[i]` with its new value. In each pass, we effectively reduce the "active" size of the array by one, until only the first element contains the final result.

## üíª Solution Code

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Brute-force Solution (Extra Space)

This solution follows the problem description exactly by creating a new temporary vector in each iteration.

```cpp
// Intuition:
// The problem can be solved by directly simulating the process described. We can repeatedly generate
// a new, smaller array from the current one until only a single element remains. This new array's
// elements are the sum modulo 10 of adjacent elements from the previous array.

// Approach:
// 1. Use a `while` loop that continues as long as the array size is greater than 1.
// 2. Inside the loop, create a temporary vector `temp` to store the results of the current step.
// 3. Iterate through the `nums` array from the first element to the second-to-last element.
// 4. For each pair of adjacent elements `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]`, calculate their sum modulo 10 and push it into `temp`.
// 5. After the loop, the `temp` vector will be one element shorter than `nums`.
// 6. Replace `nums` with `temp` for the next iteration. `std::move` is used for an efficient transfer, avoiding a full copy.
// 7. When the loop terminates (`nums.size()` is 1), the only element `nums[0]` is the triangular sum.

// Time Complexity: O(n^2)
// The outer while loop runs `n-1` times. The inner for loop runs `n-1`, `n-2`, ..., `1` times.
// The total number of operations is proportional to the sum of an arithmetic series, which is O(n^2).

// Space Complexity: O(n)
// In each iteration, a new temporary vector is created. The largest temporary vector has a size of `n-1`.
// Thus, the auxiliary space complexity is linear with respect to the input size.

class Solution {
public:
    int triangularSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Continue the process until only one element remains in the array.
        while(nums.size() > 1) {
            // Create a temporary vector to store the new row of the triangle.
            vector<int> temp;

            // Iterate through adjacent elements of the current array.
            for(int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
                // Calculate the sum modulo 10 and add it to the new vector.
                temp.push_back((nums[i] + nums[i + 1]) % 10);
            }

            // Replace the original array with the new one using std::move for efficiency.
            nums = move(temp);
        }
        // The final remaining element is the triangular sum.
        return nums[0];
    }
};

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Optimized Solution (In-place)

This solution modifies the input array directly, achieving $O(1)$ space complexity.

```cpp
// Intuition:
// Instead of creating a new array at each step, we can perform the updates in-place. The value at
// `nums[i]` for the next iteration depends only on `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` from the current
// iteration. We can overwrite `nums[i]` with the new value, effectively shrinking the conceptual
// size of the array by one in each pass.

// Approach:
// 1. Get the initial size `n` of the array.
// 2. Use an outer loop that simulates the shrinking size of the array. It runs from `size = n-1` down to `1`.
//    This `size` variable represents the number of elements in the current conceptual array.
// 3. The inner loop iterates from `i = 0` to `size - 1` (or `i < size`).
// 4. In the inner loop, update `nums[i]` directly with the new value: `(nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10`.
// 5. After each pass of the outer loop, the first `size` elements of `nums` are updated, and the array
//    is conceptually one element shorter.
// 6. When the loops complete, `nums[0]` will hold the final triangular sum.

// Time Complexity: O(n^2)
// The nested loop structure leads to a quadratic time complexity, similar to the brute-force approach.
// The outer loop runs `n-1` times, and the inner loop's iterations decrease from `n-1` to `1`.

// Space Complexity: O(1)
// The array is modified in-place. No extra space proportional to the input size is used.

class Solution {
public:
    int triangularSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        // The outer loop reduces the effective size of the array in each iteration.
        for(int size = n - 1; size >= 1; size--) {
            // The inner loop computes the new values for the current row.
            for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                // Update the current element with the sum of itself and the next element, modulo 10.
                nums[i] = (nums[i] + nums[i + 1]) % 10;
            }
        }
        // The final result is stored in the first element of the array.
        return nums[0];
    }
};

## üîë Key Insights

The process described is related to **Pascal's Triangle**. The final sum is a linear combination of the initial array elements, where the coefficients are binomial coefficients modulo 10. Specifically, the triangular sum is:

$$ \text{sum} = \sum\_{i=0}^{n-1} \left( \binom{n-1}{i} \times \text{nums}[i] \right) \pmod{10} $$

where `n` is the length of the initial array. While the simulation approach ($O(N^2)$) is sufficient given the constraints, this combinatorial approach could solve the problem in $O(N)$ if we could compute the binomial coefficients efficiently. However, calculating these for each term can be complex, making the simulation approach more practical for typical contest scenarios.

## üöÄ Further Exploration

- Implement the solution using the combinatorial formula with binomial coefficients. This requires pre-computing factorials and their modular inverses or using properties of Pascal's triangle.
- Consider the problem constraints. What if `nums.length` was much larger, e.g., $10^5$? The $O(N^2)$ solution would be too slow, and the $O(N)$ combinatorial approach would be necessary.
