## üìù Problem Statement

There is a programming language with only **four** operations and **one** variable `X`:

-   `++X` and `X++` **increments** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.
-   `--X` and `X--` **decrements** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.

Initially, the value of `X` is `0`.

Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return the **final** value of `X` after performing all the operations.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Constraints

-   `1 <= operations.length <= 100`
-   `operations[i]` will be either `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, or `"X--"`.

## üí° Approach

The problem asks us to calculate the final value of a variable `X` after a series of increment and decrement operations. `X` starts at 0.

The core idea is simple:
1.  Initialize a variable, let's call it `x`, to `0`.
2.  Iterate through the `operations` array one by one.
3.  For each operation string, determine if it's an increment or a decrement. A simple way to do this is to check the character at the middle index (index 1). If it's a `+`, we increment `x`. If it's a `-`, we decrement `x`.
4.  After iterating through all the operations, the final value of `x` is our answer.

This approach is straightforward and efficient as it only requires a single pass through the input array.

## üíª Solution Code

### Optimized Solution (C++)

```cpp
// Intuition: The problem requires tracking the value of a variable 'X' which is modified by a list of operations. We can simulate this by initializing a counter to zero and then iterating through the operations, adjusting the counter based on whether the operation is an increment or a decrement.

// Approach:
// 1. Initialize an integer variable 'x' to 0. This will represent the value of X.
// 2. Loop through each string 'op' in the 'operations' vector.
// 3. For each 'op', check if it represents an increment ("++X" or "X++") or a decrement ("--X" or "X--").
// 4. A simple way to check is to look at the character at index 1. If it's '+', it's an increment. If it's '-', it's a decrement.
// 5. If the operation is an increment, add 1 to 'x'.
// 6. Otherwise (if it's a decrement), subtract 1 from 'x'.
// 7. After the loop completes, return the final value of 'x'.

// Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the 'operations' array. We iterate through the array once.
// Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space (the integer 'x').

class Solution {
public:
    int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
        int x = 0; // Initialize the variable X to 0.

        // Iterate through each operation in the input vector.
        for (auto& op : operations) {
            // Check if the operation is an increment.
            if (op == "X++" || op == "++X") {
                x++; // Increment x.
            } else {
                x--; // Otherwise, it's a decrement, so decrement x.
            }
        }
        
        return x; // Return the final value of x.
    }
};

/*
*
* Dry Run
*
* Input: operations = ["--X", "X++", "X++"]
*
* 1. Initialize x = 0.
*
* 2. First operation: op = "--X"
* - The condition (op == "X++" || op == "++X") is false.
* - Enter the 'else' block.
* - Decrement x. Now, x = -1.
*
* 3. Second operation: op = "X++"
* - The condition (op == "X++" || op == "++X") is true.
* - Increment x. Now, x = -1 + 1 = 0.
*
* 4. Third operation: op = "X++"
* - The condition (op == "X++" || op == "++X") is true.
* - Increment x. Now, x = 0 + 1 = 1.
*
* 5. Loop finishes.
*
* 6. Return x, which is 1.
*
* Final Output: 1
*

## üìå Notes

-   The problem provides four different operation strings, but they boil down to just two actions: increment and decrement.
-   The key insight is that the position of `++` or `--` (prefix vs. postfix) doesn't change the outcome for this specific problem, as each operation is a distinct step.
-   A more concise check inside the loop could be `if (op[1] == '+') x++; else x--;`, which leverages the fact that the unique character for increment/decrement is always at the second position of the 3-character string.

## üîë Key Insights

-   **Simulation:** This problem is a classic example of a simulation problem where you follow the instructions step-by-step to arrive at the solution.
-   **Pattern Recognition:** Recognizing that `++X` and `X++` have the same effect (increment by 1) and `--X` and `X--` have the same effect (decrement by 1) simplifies the logic.

## üöÄ Further Exploration

-   Consider how the solution would change if the operations were part of a larger expression, where the difference between prefix (`++X`) and postfix (`X++`) would matter.
-   Think about solving this problem using a functional approach, for instance, with `std::accumulate` in C++ or `reduce` in other languages.
