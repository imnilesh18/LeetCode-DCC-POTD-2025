## 📜 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

* Select an index `i` and replace `nums[i]` with `nums[i] - 1`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make the sum of the array divisible by `k`.

## 🔒 Constraints

* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
* `1 <= k <= 100`

## 📝 Examples

| Example | Input | Output | Explanation |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|
| **1** | `nums = [3,9,7], k = 5` | `4` | Perform 4 operations on `nums[1] = 9`. Now, `nums = [3, 5, 7]`. The sum is 15, which is divisible by 5. |
| **2** | `nums = [4,1,3], k = 4` | `0` | The sum is 8, which is already divisible by 4. Hence, no operations are needed. |
| **3** | `nums = [3,2], k = 6` | `5` | Perform 3 operations on `nums[0] = 3` and 2 operations on `nums[1] = 2`. Now, `nums = [0, 0]`. The sum is 0, which is divisible by 6. |

## 💡 Approach

The problem asks us to minimize the number of subtraction operations (decrementing values by 1) to make the total sum of the array divisible by `k`.

1.  **Calculate Total Sum**: First, we find the sum of all elements in the array `nums`.
2.  **Determine Remainder**: When we divide a number `S` by `k`, the remainder `r = S % k` represents the "excess" amount over the nearest smaller multiple of `k`.
3.  **Calculate Operations**: Since each operation reduces the sum by exactly 1, removing this "excess" remainder `r` will bring the sum down to exactly a multiple of `k`. Thus, the minimum number of operations required is simply `sum % k`.

This is a direct application of modular arithmetic.

## 💻 Solution Code

```cpp
// Intuition: The number of operations needed to make the sum divisible by k is simply the remainder of the sum when divided by k.
// Approach: Calculate the total sum of the array elements and return sum % k.
// Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of elements in nums, as we iterate once to find the sum.
// Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use a variable to store the sum (handled internally by accumulate).

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Calculate sum of all elements starting from 0
        // Then return the remainder when divided by k
        return accumulate(begin(nums), end(nums), 0) % k;
    }
};

/*
*
* Dry Run
* Input: nums = [3, 9, 7], k = 5
*
* 1. accumulate(begin(nums), end(nums), 0)
* - Sum = 3 + 9 + 7 = 19
*
* 2. Perform modulo operation: 19 % 5
* - 19 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 4
*
* 3. Return 4
* - This means we need 4 subtraction operations to reach 15 (next lower multiple of 5).
*
*/
```

## 🔑 Key Insights

* **Operation Equivalence**: Decrementing an element by 1 is the same as decrementing the total sum by 1.
* **Goal**: We want `(TotalSum - Operations) % k == 0`.
* **Minimization**: To minimize `Operations`, we just need to subtract the remainder of `TotalSum` divided by `k`.
* **Efficiency**: The solution relies on a single pass to compute the sum, making it highly efficient.
